# Write a function that returns all the possible paths between A­-H.

All path can be found by DFS

# Write a function that returns the least number of hops (shortest path) between A­-H.

Shortest path can be found by BFS if the edges are unweighted. For weighted graph, we can use Dijkstra algorithm.
